Hand-coded portfolio project for SI 539: Design of Complex Websites.

Project Specifications:
About this project….
This portfolio can cover any topic you would like - a personal portfolio about yourself, a business page for someone else, a site for a student group, an homage to pot-belly pigs…  The content is up to you. 

However, while the content is up to you and we hope that you can create something you can reuse, it is foremost an assignment to evaluate your ability to complete specific concepts.  So while you may not want to add some of the requirements below, they are required.  And while some students may not think accessibility errors are important, they are.

You may not use an existing template to complete any of the requirements.  But you can use templates/libraries to augment your site.

Required Minimum content:
Submit a (minimum four page) site.  All of the pages must use a common header, footer, and navigation across all pages. 
You may not do a single page site for this portfolio
Copying code for footer from previous assignment will only be partial credit.


The navigation must clearly display the current page within the nav element. (I should be able to tell which page I am on based on the styling of the link to the current page.  Don’t forget, that color alone should not be used to convey meaning.)


Each page should contain a main section that can be reached using a Jump to Content option with the first tab on the page.  Main must be after the navigation.


With the exception of a landing page (if you decided to have one), each page must have a minimum of three paragraphs of text or five images or a combination of images and text.  This is a minimum.  If you are in doubt, add more.


A gallery with at least nine distinct images.  These images should use filters and pseudo-classes to animate the gallery.


A component that uses grid - Copying code from previous assignment will only be partial credit.


A component that uses flexbox - Copying code from previous assignment will only be partial credit.


At least one CSS generated animation that is NOT part of the gallery.  Make sure to write a media query to turn it off as well.


A working contact form.


A parallax image.


A keyboard accessible flip card using just CSS


 Google Analytics on all four pages.

Requirements 8-13 must be done independently. (And by independently this also means without help from your classmates unless it is on Piazza.)  Please check the rubric - they do not carry a high point value.
 
Required Responsive Design:
Three different layouts/functionalities - mobile, tablet, and larger screen.  
The navigation must differ on all three views.
The media queries should cause structural changes to at least two of the pages - the flow of elements must change, elements must hide, or grid/flex properties should be altered.  
Using flex is not responsive design unless some of the flex properties are significantly updated using media queries.


You must write at least two media queries based on viewport size.  



Required Documentation
A description of your responsive design choices and how to trigger them.  You are responsible for creating at least two media queries based on width (combined with fluid measurements of course).  You must explain how your code improves the page, not just changes it. If you used Bootstrap, that can count as an “extra” but not one of the required two media queries.


A description of where to find your uses of grid and flexbox.  In addition to the location, you must explain why your choice is the most logical choice for that layout.   I expect that at least two containers will use grid or flex or that the same container will be used on multiple pages.


Each page must validate on w3, Wave, and aXe.   If there are errors on the page (including contrast errors) you must include an itemized list of why each error is not an issue, e.g. background image negates color contrast error.  To repeat, you may NOT have contrast errors on Wave, but aXe is okay.  (If you really like your colors, use w3 to test making them slightly darker or lighter and/or you can increase the font size.)  Submit the 12 screenshots as part of your report.  The 12 images should be each of the four pages via aXe, wave, and w3 validator.   Make sure to have a colleague check your site as well to ensure that the validators are working.


Include a screenshot of the working Google Analytics for all four pages.
All documentation should be in a Google Doc.  Include the link to the Google Doc in the comments section of your submission and make sure that we can open it.
 
Other things we are looking for:
Great responsive design.  I want to be impressed with at least three different behaviors or layouts.


Visually appealing.  Nothing is broken, sloppy, or awkward. Tell us how you chose/generated your color palette.  


The content is complete - no broken links, content is cohesive.


Enhanced accessibility.
